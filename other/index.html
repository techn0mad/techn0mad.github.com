    <h2>Quotes</h2>

    <p>It is not about solving puzzles and being the brightest kid
    in the class. It is about realizing that the complexity of
    software dwarfs even the most brilliant human; that cleverness
    cannot win. The only weapons we have are simplicity and
    convention. Tattoo that on your forehead in reverse so that you
    always see it reflected in the screen. What is truly decisive
    on the battlefield are attitudes: hard work, responsibility,
    and paying attention to reality instead of the voiceover in
    your head.</p><cite>Johnathan Edwards, from his post "Mea
    Culpa" on his <a href=

    <p>Peace of mind is not at all superficial to technical work.
    It's the whole thing. That which produces it is good work and
    that which destroys it is bad work. The specs, the measuring
    instruments, the quality control, the final check-out, these
    are all means toward the end of satisfying the peace of mind of
    those responsible for the work. In the end, what matters is
    their peace of mind, nothing else.</p><cite>-- Robert M.

    <p>Programming today is a race between software engineers
    striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and
    the Universe trying to build bigger and better idiots. So far,
    the Universe is winning.</p><cite>Rich Cook</cite>
    <hr width="70%" />

    <p>[A colleague of mine (who happens to be an RF engineer who
    does not normally do any software work) sent me a link to
    <a href=
    "http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff">this
    article</a>, which contains the quote below. I thought it was
    excellent, and should be required reading for anyone who is
    involved with trying to schedule, plan, estimate, or manage
    software development. In the end, what I read from it is what
    the <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/">SEI institute</a>
    takes a lot more time to say: Your software is a function of
    your organization and your process: If you don't know how they
    work, you won't know how your software works.]</p>

    <p>And that's the point: the shuttle process is so extreme, the
    drive for perfection is so focused, that it reveals what's
    required to achieve relentless execution. The most important
    things the shuttle group does -- carefully planning the
    software in advance, writing no code until the design is
    complete, making no changes without supporting blueprints,
    keeping a completely accurate record of the code -- are not
    expensive. The process isn't even rocket science. It's standard
    practice in almost every engineering discipline except software
    engineering.</p><cite>-- Charles Fishman<br />

    <p>The environment that nurtures creative programmers kills
    management and marketing types - and vice versa. Programming is
    the Great Game. It consumes you, body and soul. When you're
    caught up in it, nothing else matters. When you emerge into
    daylight, you might well discover that you're a hundred pounds
    overweight, your underwear is older than the average first
    grader, and judging from the number of pizza boxes lying
    around, it must be spring already. But you don't care, because
    your program runs, and the code is fast and clever and tight.
    You won.</p>

    <p>You're aware that some people think you're a nerd. So what?
    They're not players. They've never jousted with Windows or gone
    hand to hand with DOS. To them C++ is a decent grade, almost a
    B - not a language. They barely exist. Like soldiers or
    artists, you don't care about the opinions of civilians. You're
    building something intricate and fine. They'll never understand
    it.</p>

    <p>Here's the secret that every successful software company is
    based on: You can domesticate programmers the way beekeepers
    tame bees. You can't exactly communicate with them, but you can
    get them to swarm in one place and when they're not looking,
    you can carry off the honey.</p>

    <p>You keep these bees from stinging by paying them money. More
    money than they know what to do with. But that's less than you
    might think. You see, all these programmers keep hearing their
    fathers' voices in their heads saying "When are you going to
    join the real world?" All you have to pay them is enough money
    that they can answer (also in their heads) "Geez, Dad, I'm
    making more than you." On average, this is cheap.</p>

    <p>And you get them to stay in the hive by giving them other
    coders to swarm with. The only person whose praise matters is
    another programmer. Less-talented programmers will idolize
    them; evenly matched ones will challenge and goad one another;
    and if you want to get a good swarm, you make sure that you
    have at least one certified genius coder that they can all look
    up to, even if he glances at other people's code only long
    enough to sneer at it.</p>

    <p>He's a Player, thinks the junior programmer. He looked at my
    code. That is enough. If a software company provides such a
    hive, the coders will give up sleep, love, health, and clean
    laundry, while the company keeps the bulk of the money.</p>

    <p>Here's the problem that ends up killing company after
    company. All successful software companies had, as their
    dominant personality, a leader who nurtured programmers. But no
    company can keep such a leader forever. Either he cashes out,
    or he brings in management types who end up driving him out, or
    he changes and becomes a management type himself. One way or
    another, marketers get control.</p>

    <p>But...control of what? Instead of finding assembly lines of
    productive workers, they quickly discover that their product is
    produced by utterly unpredictable, uncooperative, disobedient,
    and worst of all, unattractive people who resist all attempts
    at management. Put them on a time clock, dress them in suits,
    and they become sullen and start sabotaging the product. Worst
    of all, you can sense that they are making fun of you with
    every word they say.</p>

    <p>The shock is greater for the coder, though. He suddenly
    finds that alien creatures control his life. Meetings,
    Schedules, Reports. And now someone demands that he PLAN all
    his programming and then stick to the plan, never improving,
    never tweaking, and never, never touching some other team's
    code. The lousy young programmer who once worshipped him is now
    his tyrannical boss, a position he got because he played golf
    with some sphincter in a suit.</p>

    <p>The hive has been ruined. The best coders leave. And the
    marketers, comfortable now because they're surrounded by power
    neckties and they have things under control, are baffled that
    each new iteration of their software loses market share as the
    code bloats and the bugs proliferate. Got to get some better
    packaging. Yeah, that's it.</p><cite>Software - How Software

    <p>There are two ways of constructing a software design. One
    way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no
    deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated
    that there are no obvious deficiencies.</p><cite>C.A.R.

    <p>"So we went to Atari and said, 'Hey, we've got this amazing
    thing, even built with some of your parts, and what do you
    think about funding us? Or we'll give it to you. We just want
    to do it. Pay our salary, we'll come work for you.' And they
    said, 'No.' So then we went to Hewlett-Packard, and they said,
    'Hey, we don't need you. You haven't got through college
    yet.'"</p><cite>Apple Computer Inc. founder Steve Jobs on
