<h1>Part 2 - The First Mixer &amp; Local Oscillator</h1>
<i>by Larry Gadallah</i>
<br/>
</center>

<h2>The First Mixer:</h2>

<p>The first mixer's job is to take the RF signals provided by the
front end and to shift them in frequency for presentation to the
first intermediate frequency (1st IF) amplifiers, filters, and
finally the detectors. The mixer must handle the full range of
signals presented to the receiver; both weak and strong signals at
the extremes of the receiver's frequency coverage. Mixers are
three-port devices, meaning that they are devices which have have
three inputs or outputs. The first mixer in a receiver has RF
signals from the front end and the local oscillator signal (LO) as
inputs and the 1st IF signal as an output.</p>

<h3>Linearity &amp; Dynamic Range</h3>

<p>More than any other single stage in a receiver, the first mixer
determines the dynamic range of a receiver. Older semiconductor
receivers that used early designs of transistorized mixers
typically exhibited horrible dynamic range and collapsed under
practical signal conditions. For modern high-performance receivers,
the first mixer design is critical.</p>

<p>There are two main types of mixers: passive and active. The
simpler and cheaper of these is the passive design, which is
usually implemented using a set of precision matched hot carrier or
microwave diodes (called a diode ring). These are specially chosen
to exhibit nearly perfect diode characteristics at high
frequencies. Diode rings have an advantage in that they are
inherently broadband devices. One of the main disadvantages of them
is that they require a high level of drive power from the local
oscillator to obtain good dynamic range performance..</p>

<p>Currently, active mixers can provide the highest dynamic range
available, using VMOS field effect transistors (FETs). These VMOS
devices work extremely well because they are excellent switching
devices at high frequencies. A significant disadvantage they have
is that they require a high drive voltage from the local
oscillator. Typically, this means that tuned circuits must be used
between the VMOS devices and the local oscillator. This severely
restricts the bandwidth of the mixer and causes difficulties with
impedance matching. Nonetheless, modern mixer designs using VMOS
FETs can attain dynamic range figures of 120 to 140 dB, as compared
to figures like 100 to 110 dB for the best amateur radio equipment
available commercially today.</p>

<h3>Impedance Matching</h3>

<p>More early semiconductor mixers suffered from poor performance
due to impedance mismatching more than any other factor. In
general, if a mixer's inputs and outputs are not properly
terminated over its operating range, the mixer's dynamic range and
linearity will be severely limited. This is one reason why passive
diode ring mixers are much simpler to build than active mixers:
These circuits are broadband by their nature and present a more
constant impedance across their operating range than do active
mixers.</p>

<h3>Attenuation/Gain</h3>

<p>Typically, active mixers provide a slight gain at the expense of
added noise. Passive mixers generally contribute less noise but
also exhibit a slight attenuation. In modern receiver designs,
these factors are normally irrelevant since most of the receiver's
gain should be provided in the IF stages rather than at the front
end and any loss in the mixer circuit can easily be recovered in
the following stages.</p>

<p>For a homebrew receiver, the passive diode ring mixer is the
easiest design to build. Often these can be purchased preassembled.
Active mixers can provide superior performance to diode ring
mixers, but they require specialized equipment to assemble and
test. Perhaps preassembled VMOS FET mixers will become available in
the future at which point they would become the superior
choice..</p>

<h2>The Local Oscillator:</h2>

<p>The Local Oscillator, or LO, is the main unit controlled by a
receiver's tuning controls. It determines what signal from the
front end will fall within the IF strip's passband. The purity of
the signal produced by the LO is very important, because any noise
in the LO output will be combined with signals from the front end
at the appropriate frequencies and will end up in the IF
passband.</p>

<h3>Analog VFOs</h3>

<p>The LO is generally required to be a variable frequency
oscillator, and it is desirable for it to tune over as wide a range
as possible. Older sets mainly used mechanical variable capacitors
as the tuning elements. These had a number of disadvantages, often
including poor temperature stability and linearity. Better sets,
such as those built by Drake or Collins often had permeability
tuned oscillators or PTOs. These are generally held to be the best
mechanical tuning devices built for use in variable frequency
oscillators (VFOs). They were stable, exhibited a linear mechanical
vs.inductance characteristic, and allowed high resolution
mechanical tuning dials to be built.</p>

<h3>Digital VFOs (Synthesizers)</h3>

<p>Today, most sets use phase locked loop frequency synthesizers
(PLLs) for their LOs. The PLL is a well known circuit, and it
offers some key advantages, including stability, precision, and
digital control. However, it also exhibits some crippling
disadvantages: PLLs with high divide ratios exhibit large amounts
of noise near their output frequencies and have a limited frequency
resolution (typically 100 Hz in modern radios). In order to reduce
this noise to acceptable levels, some very complex circuitry is
being used. This complex circuitry contributes a great deal to the
cost of high-performance receivers today.</p>

<p>There is a new breed of frequency synthesizer beginning to
appear in consumer electronics: The direct digital synthesis (DDS)
frequency synthesizer. The design of these units is not new, what
is new is the VLSI integrated circuits that make DDS synthesizers
practical to build today. The DDS has been in use in very exotic
(and expensive) military and aerospace equipment for some time, but
now some companies are offering DDS chipsets for a couple of
hundred dollars. This is an excellent price for the qualities that
DDS synthesizers have to offer: low noise (if used correctly),
almost infinite frequency resolution (1 Hz is quite easy to
achieve), and extremely fast frequency lock (measured in
nanoseconds). For the amateur receiver builder, these chips are the
answer to synthesizer design, which would be a very major deterrent
to receiver building otherwise.</p>

<p>For a homebrew receiver, a DDS chipset provides a solution to
what would likely otherwise be the most difficult portion of the
receiver design.</p>
