The Drake SPR-4 receiver was the first "serious" radio I owned, 
and in some ways, it was the one
of the best. I dreamed about this radio through my last couple of
years of high school, and sometime around 1980, I bought one that
belonged to Drake's Western Canadian distributor, Bob Fransen,
VE6RF. Now Bob is a real (European) craftsman-type, so the set was
in immaculate shape. Unfortunately, due to a financial disagreement
with my landlord, I only had this set for a couple of months before
I sold it back to Bob. Later, when I wanted to (re-)purchase it,
Bob had sold it to a friend of his.</p>

<p>Not long after that, I purchased an SPR-4/FS-4 from Don Moman,
shortly after I met him. I used this pair for about a year, before
I sold them to a friend of mine. He is still using them
occasionally. I went on to many more modern receivers from Yaesu
and Icom. Many years later, I bought another SPR-4, but I think
that this one was in poor shape, and the front-end had been damaged
by static or lightning. It didn't seem to be in as good shape as
the first one, so I sold it off. Today, I'd love to find an SPR-4
in good shape, or even in condition suitable for restoration.</p>

<p>The SPR-4 is an excellent receiver mainly thanks to it's
precision tuned front-end preselector. This gang-tuned PTO
preselector protects the dual-gate MOSFET first mixer from
overloading and intermod by simply heavily attenuating everything
more than about 20 kHz either side of the signal frequency. The VFO
is implemented with the famous Drake PTO, and has excellent
frequency resolution for an analog VFO. The scale could readily be
read to less than 500 Hz. All of the circuitry is solid-state, and
the dial lamps draw more current than the rest of the set (at least
at normal audio levels).&nbsp; The audio quality and fidelity is
outstanding, thanks to the 4 pole L-C IF filters used in the 50 kHz
second IF stages. These aren't as sharp as a mechanical or crystal
filter, but they don't suffer from the group delay and ringing of
"brickwall" filters. As many have pointed out, this can make quite
a difference when listening to a very weak MW AM signal beside a
local powerhouse with all of the attendant "splatter".</p>

<p>The main disadvantages of the set are the limited coverage and
slow bandchange/slewing operations. There is a 23 position
bandswitch (manufactured for 23 channel CB radios?) which selects
one of 23 crystals, which in turn activate one of 23 500 kHz bands.
If you were lucky, you could find one of the rare FS-4
synthesizers, which provided full coverage without any crystals. If
you wanted to change bands, you would have to change the crystal
switch to the appropriate band, change the band switch to the band
indicated by the crystal switch, and then tune the preselector to
the range indicated. This is a little awkward when you are trying
to check parallels, a second receiver is almost mandatory.</p>

<p>My best logging on an SPR-4 was probably KIKI in Honolulu,
Hawaii on 730 kHz, using a 400 foot beverage at my parent's farm
near Edmonton, Alberta. What I remember more clearly, though, is
the first time I turned on my first SPR-4; I arrived home late at
night, and excitedly hooked up the radio and tuned to 20 meters. I
was astonished at how easy it was to tune in and listen to the
Russian and Eastern European hams on SSB, and that they were coming
in so clearly that late at night. It was quite a step up from my
old Heathkit GR-78, which required a safecracker's touch to tune in
SSB stations. Some would argue that for DXpeditions, especially for
MW DXing, there isn't anything that tops the Drake SPR-4. The R-390
or SP-600 boatanchors may outperform it in terms of ultimate
performance, but Arnold Schwartzenegger hasn't accepted my
invitation to our next DXpedition.
