<h1>Part 1 - Front Ends</h1>
<i>by Larry Gadallah</i>
<br/>

</center>

<p>Back in the early 1980s, I decided that I would like to build my
own state of the art receiver for DXing and SWLing. At that time I
began collecting all sorts of engineering information about various
circuits and devices to use as references for my receiver design.
Today, almost a decade later I have revived my project. I thought
that perhaps other DXers might be interested in what I have found.
So I offer the first installment of my receiver design:</p>

<h2>Front End Design:</h2>

<p>There are two roles performed by a receiver's front end: The
front end provides either gain or attenuation as needed, and it
also often provides some amount of RF selectivity. This is what the
"Preselector" or "Antenna Tune" control does on some sets. By
themselves, these two roles are not too difficult to accomplish,
but when you include the requirements for very high dynamic range
and ultra-linear operation, they become more challenging. Having a
high dynamic range, in simple terms, means that your receiver is
able to receive a weak signal on one frequency without being
affected by other much stronger signals nearby. In modern reception
environments, often a receiver is faced with adjacent signals
having more than 100 dB difference in strength, the front-end of a
receiver bears the brunt of this onslaught of signals. Poor dynamic
range in a receiver is almost always accompanied by a front-end
design containing devices operating in their non-linear ranges
which leads to cross-modulation, intermodulation distortion (IMD)
and related undesired effects.</p>

<h2>RF Selectivity</h2>

<p>In the olden days, most receivers had the aforementioned
"Preselector" or "Antenna Tune" controls, but they are generally
avoided today because they make it impossible to change frequencies
quickly. In general they have been abandoned in favour of banks of
fixed bandpass filters that are switched in and out depending upon
what frequency range you are listening to. Often this switching is
done automatically, but on some sets, like the Drake R-7 the user
was forced to switch the front-end filters manually. Some more
exotic schemes used a true tuned preselector with electronic tuning
done by the microprocessor controlling the receiver, but the use of
non-linear devices such as varactor diodes in the front-end is
begging for trouble with dynamic range and cross modulation. For
the homebrew receiver, the best solution is the fixed bandpass
filters. These are relatively simple to construct, they can be
manually or automatically switched, and they cause minimal loss and
non-linearity. In older receiver designs, image rejection was a
problem that was typically solved with the use of selectivity in
the front-end. In older designs, the first intermediate frequency
(IF) was almost always below the receiving frequency. This caused
problems in that the image frequency was relatively near the
receiving frequency and had to be filtered out. Today most
receivers use an up-conversion technique where the first IF is much
higher than the receiving frequency and thus the image frequency is
higher yet. This has eliminated the need for complex tracking
preselectors, but it also makes it a good idea to include a good
low pass filter in the front-end to reject both the IF and image
frequencies while passing all receiving frequencies.</p>

<h2>Attenuation/Gain</h2>

<p>Older receivers, particularly those built after the introduction
of the bipolar transistor often had an "Attenuator" control. This
was a remedy for the very poor dynamic range that these receivers
often suffered from. Tube-type receivers had a greater dynamic
range and did not suffer as much from overload. Thanks to newer
technology in transistors, this is not nearly the problem it used
to be. However, the radio spectrum today is even more crowded. Now,
more than ever before higher power broadcasts are sent via
thousands of transmitters. So on many relatively recent receivers
you can often find an "RF Attenuator" control. This is useful in
some situations, but it requires manual control. The state of the
art solution is to provide a PIN diode attenuator. This allows the
same function and range as a manual attenuator, but it may be
controlled by the receiver's AGC circuit or by a
microprocessor.</p>

<p>Gain in the front-end is another design concept used in older
receiver designs. In general, this lead to a number of problems,
mostly related to the reduction of dynamic range by the RF
amplifier stage used to provide gain. Several modern receivers
still provide gain in the front-end, albeit in the form of a preamp
which may be used or bypassed at the operator's convenience (i.e.
Icom R-71). For many applications, especially in the lower HF
bands, for MW and LW use, there is no real need for gain in the
front-end. The IF and audio stages of the receiver will provide the
necessary gain and the signal to noise ratio is determined by
atmospheric and man-made noise. The use of a preamplifier stage in
the front- end becomes useful at the higher HF bands (20 MHz and
above) where it can improve the signal to noise ratio of the
received signal if designed correctly.</p>

<p>Older preamplifier stages suffered from poor dynamic range and
non-linear operation which led to cross modulation and other
problems. These stages were often controlled by the receiver's AGC
which lead to more problems with dynamic range and AGC "pumping"
effects. Modern transistors, such as power FETs (field effect
transistors) and bipolars, designed for ultralinear applications
such as cable TV distribution amplifiers, can provide excellent
dynamic range and linearity. Such devices can be used for front-end
preamplifers, but such a preamplifier should be an optional item in
the front end. At high frequencies, in some cases, the preamplifier
can help enormously but in general the use of a preamplifier just
shifts the burden of providing a good dynamic range and linearity
to the first mixer stage so the preamplifier stage should be able
to be switched in or out at will.</p>

<p>The <a href="firstmix.html">next installment</a> will be about
the first mixer and VFO stages.
