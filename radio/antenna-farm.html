    <H2>What is an Antenna Farm?</H2>

    <P>An Antenna Farm is a piece of (rural) land selected for use
    in shortwave radio listening (SWL) and/or amateur radio
    activities, especially for the purposes of listening to or
    communicating with distant (DX) stations.</P>

    <H2>Why is it Needed?</H2>

    <P>The answer to this is simple: Noise. Every household, car,
    business, factory produces a great deal of radio frequency
    interference (RFI), which affects all forms of radio
    communications; AM and FM radio, cellular, and TV. The extent
    to which it affects these communications is directly related to
    the strength of the desired signal as compared to the local
    noise.</P>

    <P>In most common uses of radio, in the cities and towns, the
    amount of RFI (noise) is very large, but the desired signals
    are also very strong and very local so there are no problems in
    communicating.</P>

    <P>In the SWL and Amateur Radio worlds, the desired signal is
    often very weak and distant (DX) and is easily obscured or
    impaired by noise and more local signals. Coincidentally, the
    most desireable signals are in the 0.5 to 5 Mhz range where RFI
    is most intense. The primary solution to this problem is to
    move the receiving antennas away from the sources of noise.</P>

    <P>A secondary reason for antenna farming is to obtain the
    space to erect the large antennas required for optimal
    reception of weak DX signals. Some of the most desireable
    antennas for DXing (Beverage antenna) are literally thousands
    of feet long.</P>

    <H2>Siting of Antenna Farms</H2>

    <P>The quality of an antenna farm is related to a number of
    attributes:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Distance from Noise Sources

        <UL>
          <LI>Power Lines, Street Lights, Television Sets</LI>

          <LI class="c3">
            <P>Power Lines, Street Lights, and TV sets are the
            major sources of RFI, so distance from them is crucial
            for a good antenna farm. RFI can be radiated for
            several miles from a faulty power line, so the fewer
            and more distant the local power lines, the better. The
            same comments apply to the "yard lights" often found on
            farms in rural areas. A survey of the RFI at the site,
            at different times of day and night, and ideally in
            different weather conditions, is mandatory to evaluate
            the quality of the site.</P>

            <P>Some other particularly nasty RFI generators include
            electric fences and "bug zappers".</P>
          </LI>

          <LI>Towns and Cities</LI>

          <LI>Industrial Areas</LI>

          <LI class="c3">
            <P>Towns and Cities and Industrial Areas are filled
            with Power Lines and Street Lights, so distance from
            them is also critical.</P>
          </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>

      <LI>Topology

        <UL>
          <LI>Negative Horizon</LI>

          <LI class="c4">A negative horizon means that the actual
          horizon is below where it would appear if the ground were
          perfectly flat for an infinite distance. If you imagine
          standing on the highest hill in an area and looking into
          the distance, you would see a negative horizon in all
          directions. Conversely, if you were in a valley in the
          mountains, you would see a positive horizon. Generally,
          if the land has a slope, it should slope down towards the
          direction of desired reception. If the site is on top of
          a hill, the land will slope down in all directions, hence
          improving reception in all directions.

            <P>In mid-western North America, the most distant
            targets are in Africa, the Mid-East, and South-West
            Asia. This means that the ideal site is higher on the
            western and southern edges, sloping down to the eastern
            and northern edges.</P>
          </LI>

          <LI>Shadowing of Nearby Transmitters</LI>

          <LI class="c3">
            <P>Distant hills and ridges can be an advantage if they
            shield the site from the strong interfering signals of
            local transmitters. This needs to be tempered with the
            fact that they will also adversely affect desired
            signals coming from the same direction.</P>
          </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>

      <LI>Soil Qualities

        <UL>
          <LI>Conductivity</LI>

          <LI class="c3">
            <P>Depending upon the exact type of antennas in use and
            the type of reception desired, the electrical
            conductivity of the soil at the site would ideally be
            either very conductive or not at all. In most cases,
            the best compromise is soil that is somewhat more
            conductive than normal. The ideal situation is to be
            adjacent to salt water (i.e. on the coast of an ocean),
            but in the mid-west this is difficult to arrange. Good
            quality farmland typically has slightly better than
            average conductivity and hence is ideal for these
            purposes.</P>
          </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>

      <LI>Size

        <P>Typical Beverage antennas are on the order of 1000 feet
        long, and typically an array of these to cover the most
        interesting areas of the world consists of 6 to 10 antennas
        arranged in a "wagon wheel" shape. This means that ideally,
        the size of the site should be about 2000 by 2000 feet or
        greater. This translates to approximately 100 acres, but
        depending upon the shape of the property, even 80 acres is
        sufficient. Sites of 100 acres or larger are ideal,
        depending upon the shape of the property.</P>

        <P>It is important to note that the Beverage antennas are
        similar in appearance to a barbed wire fence line (albeit
        taller) and so the land they are over can still be used for
        agriculture or other purposes as long as care is taken to
        keep livestock or machinery from interfering with them or
        vice-versa. This implies that land which can be leased out
        for agricultural or oil/gas purposes is especially
        desireable due to the additional income leasing would
        generate and the fact that the land would not become idle.
        It is even better if the site can remain classified as
        agricultural land due to the taxation advantages and
        protection from urbanization that this status often
        confers.</P>

        <P>It is even theoretically possible to purchase a much
        smaller site, just the building site (perhaps 5 to 10
        acres), from a farmer and then lease the antennae
        rights-of-way from the farmer. The amount of land that the
        antennae occupy is minimal (like a barbed wire fence) and
        the farmer does not lose any of the agricultural use of the
        land. There are some slight inconveniences in maneuvering
        farm machinery around the antennae, but other than that
        there are no negative impacts on the productivity of the
        land.</P>
      </LI>
    </OL>

    <H2>Practical Considerations</H2>

    <P>Unless an unmanned site is being planned, a number of
    practical considerations affect the selection of a site. We
    will not discuss unmanned sites here, due to the complications
    related to securing such sites from vandalism and theft.</P>

    <P>Each site requires an area which is suitable for building
    structures on. A piece of swampland which is ideal in all other
    respects could be difficult to place buildings on, unless it
    has a high portion. High and dry land is obviously ideal in
    this respect.</P>

    <P>The site must be reasonably accessible at all times of the
    year. In order to continue operating it must be possible to
    travel to the site and to haul supplies into it. This factor
    also affects many other practical considerations including the
    cost of building and servicing the site. It should be noted
    that vehicles are also notoriously noisy in terms of both sound
    and RFI, so siting beside a busy road is depreciated. If the
    access road is kept open in winter by plowing or other means,
    it is an additional advantage. The distance of the site from
    sources of supplies, food, gasoline, etc. is obviously also a
    factor to be considered. The closer these supplies are the
    better, providing that they are not so close that they cause
    RFI at the site.</P>

    <P>It must be possible to obtain utility hookups at a
    reasonable cost. In spite of the evils of noise carried on
    power lines, power is required to operate the equipment. It
    must also be possible to drill a good well at a reasonable cost
    or to obtain a water supply by some other means.</P>

    <P>With the continually expanding use of the Internet as an
    adjunct to amateur radio and SWLing, the availability of an
    Internet connection is also a factor to consider. This almost
    invariably would go hand-in-hand with the availability of
    telephone service. It is generally an advantage if the nearest
    telephone exchange is less than roughly 3 miles away because
    this allows for the use of technologies such as ISDN, Frame
    Relay or ADSL for Internet access.</P>

    <P>The presence of trees on the site can provide several
    advantages. They can shade and shield the building site from
    weather and wind, and they can act as supports for wire
    antennas. In exceptional cases (Pacific Northwest) the trees
    are very tall and are unequaled as supports for antennas.</P>

    <P>The local municipal government (town, county, M.D., etc.)
    should be tolerant of radio antennae and towers. Some counties,
    particularly those which are very near to large cities have
    covenants and regulations on these sorts of things which are
    often more restrictive than those in the large city. Obviously
    the taxation rates of the local government need to be taken
    into consideration too.</P>
