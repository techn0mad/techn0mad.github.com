    <P><IMG src="images/drakelogo.jpg" alt="Drake logo" vspace="5"
    hspace="5" align="left" border="off" /> The Drake SPR-4
    receiver was the first "serious" radio I owned, and in some
    ways, it was the one of the best. I dreamed about this radio
    through my last couple of years of high school, and sometime
    around 1980, I bought one that belonged to Drake's Western
    Canadian distributor, Bob Fransen, VE6RF. Now Bob is a real
    (European) craftsman-type, so the set was in immaculate shape.
    Unfortunately, due to a financial disagreement with my
    landlord, I only had this set for a couple of months before I
    sold it back to Bob. Later, when I wanted to (re-)purchase it,
    Bob had sold it to a friend of his.</P>

    <P>Not long after that, I purchased an SPR-4/FS-4 from Don
    Moman, shortly after I met him. I used this pair for about a
    year, before I sold them to a friend of mine. He is still using
    them occasionally. I went on to many more modern receivers from
    Yaesu and Icom. Many years later, I bought another SPR-4, but I
    think that this one was in poor shape, and the front-end had
    been damaged by static or lightning. It didn't seem to be in as
    good shape as the first one, so I sold it off. Today, I'd love
    to find an SPR-4 in good shape, or even in condition suitable
    for restoration.</P>

    <P>The SPR-4 is an excellent receiver mainly thanks to it's
    precision tuned front-end preselector. This gang-tuned PTO
    preselector protects the dual-gate MOSFET first mixer from
    overloading and intermod by simply heavily attenuating
    everything more than about 20 kHz either side of the signal
    frequency. The VFO is implemented with the famous Drake PTO,
    and has excellent frequency resolution for an analog VFO. The
    scale could readily be read to less than 500 Hz. All of the
    circuitry is solid-state, and the dial lamps draw more current
    than the rest of the set (at least at normal audio
    levels).&nbsp; The audio quality and fidelity is outstanding,
    thanks to the 4 pole L-C IF filters used in the 50 kHz second
    IF stages. These aren't as sharp as a mechanical or crystal
    filter, but they don't suffer from the group delay and ringing
    of "brickwall" filters. As many have pointed out, this can make
    quite a difference when listening to a very weak MW AM signal
    beside a local powerhouse with all of the attendant
    "splatter".</P>

    <P>The main disadvantages of the set are the limited coverage
    and slow bandchange/slewing operations. There is a 23 position
    bandswitch (manufactured for 23 channel CB radios?) which
    selects one of 23 crystals, which in turn activate one of 23
    500 kHz bands. If you were lucky, you could find one of the
    rare FS-4 synthesizers, which provided full coverage without
    any crystals. If you wanted to change bands, you would have to
    change the crystal switch to the appropriate band, change the
    band switch to the band indicated by the crystal switch, and
    then tune the preselector to the range indicated. This is a
    little awkward when you are trying to check parallels, a second
    receiver is almost mandatory.</P>

    <P>My best logging on an SPR-4 was probably KIKI in Honolulu,
    Hawaii on 730 kHz, using a 400 foot beverage at my parent's
    farm near Edmonton, Alberta. What I remember more clearly,
    though, is the first time I turned on my first SPR-4; I arrived
    home late at night, and excitedly hooked up the radio and tuned
    to 20 meters. I was astonished at how easy it was to tune in
    and listen to the Russian and Eastern European hams on SSB, and
    that they were coming in so clearly that late at night. It was
    quite a step up from my old Heathkit GR-78, which required a
    safecracker's touch to tune in SSB stations. Some would argue
    that for DXpeditions, especially for MW DXing, there isn't
    anything that tops the Drake SPR-4. The R-390 or SP-600
    boatanchors may outperform it in terms of ultimate performance,
    but Arnold Schwartzenegger hasn't accepted my invitation to our
    next DXpedition.</P>
