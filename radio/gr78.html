<p>My first shortwave radio was the Heathkit GR-78. My parents gave
it to me for my 15th birthday, and although Heath indicated that it
was a "10 Evening" kit, I was so excited that I stayed up for 2
nights straight and built the kit in about two and a half days.
Although I was careful with building the GR-78, I did ignore a lot of the
warnings about alignment of the RF deck. The manual would say
"don't adjust the slug in L99, it is preset at the factory" but I
would anyhow. Unfortunately, this meant that my GR-78 probably
never performed as well as it should have. I did enjoy it a great
deal regardless. I heard my first HF aero stations on the 8 Mhz
band on this radio.</p>

<p>The key weaknesses this receiver had were a very weak front end,
and no selection of IF bandwidth filters, and poor frequency
resolution. The design was a single conversion to 455 kHz so image
rejection was very poor, but it made the receiver sound "hot",
especially on a large external antenna that delivers strong
signals. The internal battery didn't have a great deal of capacity,
so portable operation was a relatively short lived activity.</p>

<p>For the money (CDN $200 in 1976) it was a fair receiver for the
dollar. Unfortunately, during the time I had this set, my listening
was very disorganized (I'm sure that it still is, relatively
speaking) so I can't recall my best catch with it, but I do
remember that it was very portable and I did drag it everywhere
with me.</p>

<p>Thanks go to Bryce,

for having the only image of a Heath GR-78 on the Internet.
