    <P><IMG src="images/drakelogo.jpg" alt="Drake logo" hspace="5"
    vspace="5" align="left" border="off" /> In late 1980, I
    collected up all of my shekels, and went back to my friendly
    Drake Dealer, Bob Fransen, VE6RF and ordered the (then new)
    R7-A receiver. I talked to a lot of folks before dropping $2400
    on this set, and it seems laughable that some of them advised
    me to build my own radio rather than spending that much money
    on a receiver. The idea isn't that ridiculous, it's just not
    very practical. Even if I gathered together $2400 worth of RF
    and other components, I'd still need about $100K worth of test
    equipment (spectrum analyzers, oscillioscopes, signal
    generators, etc.) in order to assemble the parts into something
    with the same level of performance as the R7-A.</P>

    <P>Shortly after I bought the R7-A, I met Don Moman. I didn't
    feel quite as crazy after meeting Don and I was quite relieved
    to meet someone as down to earth and practical as Don who had
    also bought an R7-A. Don is one of the most serious SWLs I know
    today, and he also introduced me to the Canadian International
    DX (CIDX) club, and shortly after we met, I was invited on a
    DXpedition to Pallisades Mountain, in Jasper National Park. On
    this trip, Don and I both brought our R7-As, and Don brought
    his Drake SPR-4 too. We had quite a formidable line-up of
    equipment on top of the mountain. Needless to say, the R7-As
    were the workhorses of the 1981 DXpedition. We made logs like
    Turkey on 182 kHz using our short (800 foot) beverage on the
    mountaintop. I took my R7-A on at least one other DXpedition,
    to the Cardinal Divide, near Hinton, Alberta with similar
    results.</P>

    <P>The R7-A, in it's day, had superior dynamic range and
    intermoduation performance, was relatively broadband, had
    excellent selectivity and sensitivity. The disadvantages of the
    R7-A were heat and power consumption, noise from the digital
    display, and (occasional) slow frequency slewing. The main VFO
    used the legendary Drake PTO, coupled with a built-in
    synthesizer and digital frequency counter (this was the
    difference between the amateur-band only R7 and the R7-A) so
    the set had 500 kHz bands, but the painful part was that you
    would tune up a 500 kHz segment, get to the top, press the band
    button to tick the synthesizer up to the next band, only to
    find yourself at the top of that segment, 500 kHz from where
    you left off. Don Moman wrote several review and modification
    articles relating to the R7-A, and one of the major faults he
    uncovered was the amount of noise that the power supply and
    digital circuitry put out. These problems could be avoided to
    some extent by using external power supplies and antennas, but
    they did get in the way of the set during MW DXing in
    particular. I've never seen a PBT (passband tuning) control as
    wide or as smooth as the one on the R7-A. The R7A is also the
    first set I owned that could hold it's own against any
    amateur-only receiver or transceiver, not that this is
    surprising, since the R7-A is a variant of the R7 amateur-only
    receiver. I attribute a lot of this to the 8 pole crystal IF
    filters. I haven't seen a CW filter yet that was as "tight" as
    the 300 Hz one I put on the R7-A.</P>
