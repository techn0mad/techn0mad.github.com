  <DIV id="main">
    <P>My first shortwave radio was the Heathkit GR-78. My parents
    gave it to me for my 15th birthday, and although Heath
    indicated that it was a "10 Evening" kit, I was so excited that
    I stayed up for 2 nights straight and built the kit in about
    two and a half days. Although I was careful with building the
    GR-78, I did ignore a lot of the warnings about alignment of
    the RF deck. The manual would say "don't adjust the slug in
    L99, it is preset at the factory" but I would anyhow.
    Unfortunately, this meant that my GR-78 probably never
    performed as well as it should have. I did enjoy it a great
    deal regardless. I heard my first HF aero stations on the 8 Mhz
    band on this radio.</P>

    <P>The key weaknesses this receiver had were a very weak front
    end, and no selection of IF bandwidth filters, and poor
    frequency resolution. The design was a single conversion to 455
    kHz so image rejection was very poor, but it made the receiver
    sound "hot", especially on a large external antenna that
    delivers strong signals. The internal battery didn't have a
    great deal of capacity, so portable operation was a relatively
    short lived activity.</P>

    <P>For the money (CDN $200 in 1976) it was a fair receiver for
    the dollar. Unfortunately, during the time I had this set, my
    listening was very disorganized (I'm sure that it still is,
    relatively speaking) so I can't recall my best catch with it,
    but I do remember that it was very portable and I did drag it
    everywhere with me.</P>
